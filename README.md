Secure and efficient file sharing via authenticated physical devices remain challenging to achieve in a cyber-physical environment, particularly due to the diversity of devices used to access the services and data. The proposed protocol is designed to achieve authentication between a physical device and a controller and to provide a secure end-to-end
communication in the architecture using IBE scheme. Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) scheme is a potential cryptographic solution that can be used to facilitated secure data
sharing. Thus , in the project we will construct an identity-based authentic data sharing (IBADS) protocol to provide data security in cyber physical environment.
